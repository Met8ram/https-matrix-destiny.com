They struggle with forgiving and often disappoint others with their sharp judgments and excessive fussiness over trivial matters. This person becomes easily offended, suspicious, and may withdraw into themselves.<\/p>\n<p>During periods of low mood, there is a tendency towards excessive eating and indulgence in loose living. There is a risk of developing various strong dependencies and harmful habits that persist throughout their lives. They wear their emotions on their sleeve, enjoy suffering, and crave constant praise and admiration. It is possible that such an individual clings too tightly to the past, lacks forgiveness and the ability to let go, which hinders personal growth.<\/p>\n<p>They forsake the pursuit of beauty and a deeper understanding of life in favor of an obsession with material possessions. Feelings of envy towards others&#8217; success often drive them towards a manic desire to be better, more talented, and more renowned, leading to bouts of workaholism to the point of exhaustion. There are periods of emptiness and self-doubt when they further withdraw from the world and become introspective.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Our free Matrix of Destiny calculation will help you find out the Destiny arcanum, calculate and decode your matrix online.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<!-- SECTION CALCULATION -->\n<div class=\"anchor-section js-anchor-section\">\n  <script>\n  console.log('one', )\n  console.log('trial', Array)\n  console.log('newpage', )\n  <\/script>\n  <section class=\"section-calculation\">\n        <div class=\"section-calculation__no-access\">\n      <div class=\"h4 mb-3\">Matrix calculation is currently not available.<\/div>\n      <div class=\"h6 mb-5\">Personal matrix check is only available when purchasing the package<\/div>\n      <a href=\"\/#section-buy\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Purchase<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n      <\/section>\n<\/div>\n<!-- SECTION CALCULATION END -->\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>14 Arcanum in society<\/h4>\n<p>For individuals with the delicate and sensitive nature of Arcanum 14 of destiny, interacting with most people can be challenging. They feel oppressed by rude, ignorant, and insolent individuals. They prefer to distance themselves as far as possible from such personalities, as they are met with contempt from the majority. They are labeled as outsiders, judged, and ostracized simply because they are different.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, it is easier to communicate indirectly with people and convey their thoughts through works of art, as the great ones have done. They must not lose heart or sever ties with society. It is important to remain composed, not succumb to depression from judgmental glances, and avoid or prevent conflictual situations. In every person, just like in a work of art, there is both beauty and the terrifying.<\/p>\n<p>It is crucial to be able to recognise the positive and accept people in all their diversity. If one creates works not just for the sake of art but to showcase their profound perspective to the world, they can teach others to appreciate beauty.<\/p>\n<h4>14 Arcanum recommendations<\/h4>\n<p>Arcanum 14 of destiny possesses a sensitive soul that can perceive beauty in the ordinary. They engage in artistic pursuits to convey their vision. Solitude fuels their creativity, but they remain connected to the world. Managing time and balancing physical and intellectual exertion are important. Releasing negativity, finding inspiration in art, and spending time near water cleanse the soul. They combat dependencies and embrace optimism. Their creative abilities resonate with those in technical professions.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend reading the <span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">description <span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">of\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #ff6600;\" href=\"http:\/\/matrix-destiny.com\/13-arcanum\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">13 Arcanum<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The description of the Arcana in the Matrix of Destiny method is very similar to the meanings of the older Tarot Arcana.\u00a0Description of the 14 Arcanum\u00a0<span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">(<a style=\"color: #ff6600;\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Temperance_(Tarot_card)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"14 Arcanum, Temperance 14 Arcanum in the \u201cplus\u201d Arcanum 14 represents a mature outlook on life regardless of age.
