It behaves aggressively, arrogantly, and engages in conflicts. The desire to be ahead of everyone else pushes it to humiliate and, often, even &#8220;destroy&#8221; friends. It cannot tolerate criticism or judgment of its actions. The surrounding individuals are perceived as enemies.<\/p>\n<p>It may exhaust its body with excessive training or workaholism. It does not know how to relax and becomes irritated with others if they are slow or inactive. It is overly demanding of its own appearance and physical condition, and it expects the same in an authoritative tone from others.<\/p>\n<p>The inability to adapt to the ebb and flow of internal energy, poor emotional and life force management. It fails to see the situation here and now, and fails to enjoy the present moment. In the pursuit of results, it overlooks the best moments. It forgets to be a simple person, a loving father, and husband. It excessively controls loved ones and forces them to live at its pace.<\/p>\n<p>Excessive demands often lead to the breakdown of families and the rupture of relationships with loyal friends. Intolerance towards others&#8217; weaknesses manifests as moralizing lectures and imposing its own methods of physical and spiritual management.<\/p>\n<h4>Our free Matrix of Destiny calculation will help you find out the Destiny arcanum, calculate and decode your matrix online.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<!-- SECTION CALCULATION -->\n<div class=\"anchor-section js-anchor-section\">\n  <script>\n  console.log('one', )\n  console.log('trial', Array)\n  console.log('newpage', )\n  <\/script>\n  <section class=\"section-calculation\">\n        <div class=\"section-calculation__no-access\">\n      <div class=\"h4 mb-3\">Matrix calculation is currently not available.<\/div>\n      <div class=\"h6 mb-5\">Personal matrix check is only available when purchasing the package<\/div>\n      <a href=\"\/#section-buy\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Purchase<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n      <\/section>\n<\/div>\n<!-- SECTION CALCULATION END -->\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>11 Arcanum society<\/h4>\n<p>Arcanum 11 represents positivity and inexhaustible energy that help individuals become organizers and the life of any gathering. They bring people together, motivate them to be active, and serve as the soul of the company. Their sociability, kindness, and positivity allow them to easily let go of negativity, resulting in a large circle of like-minded individuals, friends, and followers.<\/p>\n<p>By demonstrating wisdom and thoughtfulness in their actions, they can maintain neutrality in disputes. Conflict resolution should be approached with reason and diplomacy rather than force. Defending their position and influencing others can be more effective through the use of gentle power and persuasive arguments.<\/p>\n<h4>11 Arcanum recommendations<\/h4>\n<p>This personality type should learn to relax and give themselves some rest. Trying activities such as fitness clubs, massages, yoga, and other practices for physical and mental relaxation would be beneficial. Emotional release through family leisure time or, conversely, a day of solitude and silence can help gather thoughts and establish a more balanced approach to behavior. The focus should be on developing skills with quality rather than quantity.<\/p>\n<p>Hastily completed tasks will only do harm. Avoid rushing and learn not to push others. Accept people as they are, recognizing that not everyone possesses the same energy and life force, and that everyone has the right to live at their own pace. It&#8217;s important not to overexert oneself and to be willing to let go of some responsibilities, learning to manage one&#8217;s time effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Maintaining control over bursts of negativity and intense emotions is essential. This can be aided by special training or relaxing meditations. Alternatively, engaging in a completely different activity, such as drawing, has been proven to help cope with aggression and bad moods. It is important to prioritize spiritual development and learn to manage one&#8217;s own energy. Striving for results by any means and using force to achieve everything is not advisable.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s necessary to pause, reassess the situation, and consider taking a completely different approach or problem-solving method. The ability to see the positive aspects in everything will help avoid creating unnecessary enemies and obstacles. It is important to mature, become independent, and sever emotional ties with one&#8217;s mother. It may be challenging to accomplish planned goals if they are not approved by her, so it&#8217;s advisable to refrain from sharing certain plans unless they are likely to be approved.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend reading the <span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">description of <\/span><a style=\"color: #ff6600;\" href=\"http:\/\/matrix-destiny.com\/10-arcanum\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10 Arcanum<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The description of the Arcana in the Matrix of Destiny method is very similar to the meanings of the older Tarot Arcana.\u00a0Description of the 11 Arcanum\u00a0<span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">(<a style=\"color: #ff6600;\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Strength_(Tarot_card)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"11 Arcanum, Justice &nbsp; 11 Arcanum in the \u201cplus\u201d Arcanum 11 embodies great strength, which can manifest in various forms: physical abilities, inner resilience, or the power of persuasion.
